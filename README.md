# Diabetes-BayesianModel

Diabetes is a serious disease affecting millions of people across the entire world. Thus, correct and timely prediction of this disease, is very important due to the complications it can have in the case of other life-threatening diseases. Diabetes can be diagnosed through observation of some clinical data, in particular blood glucose level. But if blood glucose level is used to diagnose diabetes, there are other factors (called risk factors) that can suggest, but not confirm, that a patient has diabetes. The latter consideration leads to the development of this project, where we will analyze different clinical data, to understand the impact of certain risk factors, on the likelihood of developing diabetes in patients.

The objective of this project is therefore to apply the studied notions about Bayesian Networks, to implement a probabilistic model on a dataset built from patients with diabetes, to extrapolate the correlations between risk factors and diabetes.

This project was done in collaboration with @LucaZucchini97 (https://github.com/LucaZucchini97)
